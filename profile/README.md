Welcome to **HumemAI**! 🚀 This AI project, inspired by human memory and built on my PhD research, aims to create machines that can think, remember, and interact like us. 🌟

## Key Concepts

- **🧠 Human Memory**: We model short-term, long-term, and sensory memories using knowledge graphs.
- **🤝 AI Integration**: By combining symbolic AI with neural networks, HumemAI learns, stores, and retrieves information, mirroring human cognitive processes.
- **💡 Empathy & Curiosity**: The AI is designed to understand emotions and explore its environment, enhancing its interaction with humans.
